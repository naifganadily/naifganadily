        <h2>üìú About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Legacy, Inheritance & Prestige can be overlooked when you are dealing with Life. I never knew what I wanted to be as a kid, and I haven't figured it out until now. That's Great & I'm Proud of it; it keeps life interesting with full of surprises and wonders. I'm more of a dreamer than a realist, but sometimes I have to switch depending on the situation.
